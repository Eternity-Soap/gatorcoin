This is to be a very simple clone of Litecoin v0.8.7.5. I wanted to make a cryptocurrency clone and figured I may as well make the theme UF related. I do plan on making Windows executables and hosting a node for those who want to play with it. 

# TODO:
 - Set new blockchain parameters/get testnet and mainnet genesis blocks
 - New graphics
 - Change network parameters
 - Change alertnet
 - Update gitian
 - Address Identifiers
 - Transaction attributes?
