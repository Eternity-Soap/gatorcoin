This is to be a very simple clone of Litecoin v0.8.7.5. I wanted to make a cryptocurrency clone and figured I may as well make the theme UF related. I do plan on making Windows executables and hosting a node for those who want to play with it.

# Gatorcoin Properties:

- 8 minute block targets (after the 8 libraries on campus)
- Difficulty retarget every 90 blocks (about half of a day)
- Reward cut in half every 262.8k blocks, about 4 years
- Maximum coin supply will about 8146800 coins, and will be reached in 20 years
